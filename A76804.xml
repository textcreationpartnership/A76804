            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> being the tenth of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Moneth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> a great Company of young men and others, were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the ſigne of the Crowne (being the chiefeſt Inne in the town) at which Inne, moſt of the Roomes were filled, and many ſtrong arguments there held, ſome approving of the late Engagement of <hi>Poyntz,</hi> and <hi>Maſſie,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deteſting the ſame, ſaying they would live and dye with his Excellencie Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Fairfax,</hi> and that ſo long as breath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained within their Bodies, they would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice all their lives, for Himſelfe, the Army and Kingdomes Cauſe.</p>
            <p>At which expreſſion, the presbyterian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty began to tremble, and ſhewed themſelves with moſt inveterate Cullers, whereupon, great diviſions aroſe, and many vehement blowes enſued, for the forenamed parties who declared themſelves for the aforeſaid Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, immediatly retired out of their Rooms, and betook themſelves to the back yard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Wind-mill, where was a very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den engagement of a moſt deſperate and hot Encounter, ſome crying out, that they would
<pb facs="tcp:160436:2"/>live and dye for the true Worſhip and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Presbytery; others ſaying, that they would ſpend their deareſt bloud for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip of Independency; inſomuch, that at the laſt the Encounter began to be ſo hot, that the adverſe party began to practice the moving motion, and fain would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the place, but could not, by reaſon of the cloſe purſuit, whereupon they immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threw down their arms, <hi>viz.</hi> Swords, clubs, and ſuch like weapons, crying <hi>peccavi</hi> for the former Engagement, proteſting never to doe the like again.</p>
            <p>Some were wounded, but not many ſlaine except two or three.</p>
            <p>After the fight was ended, each man betook himſelf towards his own home, and thoſe that were wounded attended upon my cozen <hi>Blague</hi> the Surgeon.</p>
